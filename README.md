# ConvexSampler
Some routines to process points and convex hulls.

List of the routines currently available:
- `is_in_cvx`: determines if a set of points are in a convex hull described by its faces (see test.py)
- `is_in_cvx_grid`: determines if a set of points defined over a grid are in a convex hull described by its faces (see test_grid.py)
